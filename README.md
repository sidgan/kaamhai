kaamhai-webapp builds the war to be deployed to tomcat.
kaamhai-core builds a jar which is packaged in the war.

To build and deploy, run ./deploy.sh

TODO:
1. About the web services, I'll add swagger integration so it will be easy to play with the APIs.
Hold on till then. Swagger serves as both documentation as well as API playground for the services.


2. The next thing to do is to host these services.
Trying to identify a server to host it publicly so all of you can access.
Will keep you posted.
